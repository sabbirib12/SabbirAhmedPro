Welcome to my professional website. I am a BBA and MBA graduate from the University of Dhaka, currently pursuing my chartered accountancy qualification under The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB). 

I created this platform to share practical insights, discuss industry dynamics, and connect with fellow professionals and students who share similar interests. Through documenting my experiences and lessons learned, I hope to contribute meaningfully to our professional community.
